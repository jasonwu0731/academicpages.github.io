* I am a MPhil student in [Electronic & Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ust.hk/ece.php) at [HKUST](http://www.ust.hk/zh-hant/), working with [Prof. Pascale Fung](http://www.ece.ust.hk/~pascale/) in [Human Language Technology Center](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~hltc/) (HLTC).

* I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2016. As an undergrad researcher, I worked with Prof. [An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) in Access IC Lab, and [Dr. Jing-Sin Liu](http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liu/) in Academia Sinica, R.O.C.

* My current research topics focus on deep learning applications in [dialog systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_system), [affective computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing), and [human-robot interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction). Previously, I have also worked on speech recognition, visual question answering, compressive sensing, 5G communication, and IC design.

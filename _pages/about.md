My research interests focus on the fields of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing. In particular, sentiment and emotion analysis, task-oriented dialog systems, human-robot interactions, etc.

Currently, I am a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) student in Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Specifically, I work in the Human Language Technology Center (HLTC) with Prof. Pascale Fung. I earned my B.S. degree from the Electrical Engineering department at National Taiwan University (NTUEE). 

Dream Big, then try my best to Do Bigger. Please feel free to browse through my profile and contact me.

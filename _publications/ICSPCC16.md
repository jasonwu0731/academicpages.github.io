## Abstract
Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology for next-generation mobile communication. To overcome mmWaveâ€™s instinctive channel limitations like serious path attenuation, beamforming is essential for communication systems. In this paper, we proposed a low-complexity hybrid codebook design algorithm for mmWave MIMO motivated by Lloyd algorithm with orthogonal mapping technique motivated by Compressive Sensing (CS). Based on the proposed hybrid codebook design, RF beamforming classification (RF-C) algorithm is later proposed with reduced search effort. This work can support large number of antennas, and achieves good performance with low computational complexity and low search overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed codebook and feedback strategy reduce the search complexity by more than 85% with less than 4% performance loss compared with related work.

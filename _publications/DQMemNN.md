## Abstract
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Query Memory Network (DQMemNN) with a delexicalization mechanism for task-oriented dialog systems. The added dynamic component enables memory networks to capture the dialogâ€™s sequential dependencies by using a context-based query. Besides, the delexicalization mechanism reduces learning complexity and it alleviates the out-of-vocabulary entity problems. Experiments show that DQMemNN outper- forms original end-to-end memory network models on bAbI full-dialog task by 3.1% per-response and 39.3% per-dialog accuracy. In addition, the proposed framework achieves a promising average per-response accuracy of 99.7% and per- dialog accuracy of 97.8% without hand-crafted rules and features.
